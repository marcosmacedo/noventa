  explain_structure:
    text: "When you create a directory with brackets in its name, like `[dynamic]`, it becomes a placeholder for a URL parameter. For example, the file `web/pages/other/[dynamic]/index.html` will handle URLs like `/other/foo` or `/other/bar`."

  explain_parameter_access:
    text: "In the logic for a page or a component on that page, you can access the value of the `dynamic` parameter. It will be passed as an argument to your functions, so you can use it to fetch data or customize the content."
