## 🪩 The Web Framework That Feels Like a Party for Developers

**Noventa** is more than just a framework — it’s a *vibe*.
Designed for creators, builders, and dreamers who want to ship things that work beautifully **without fighting the framework**.

Built with **AI UX as the first-class citizen**, Noventa is engineered so that **AI Agents understand, collaborate, and code with you**. Whether you’re building alone or with AI pair programmers, Noventa helps you move from idea → code → IPO effortlessly.

## ⚡ Why Noventa?

💫 **AI-First Design Philosophy**
Crafted so AI tools can understand, generate, and refactor code within Noventa with high accuracy. Perfect for “vibe coding” or AI-assisted dev sessions.

🚀 **Blazing Fast Core**
Rust powers the core — giving you **low overhead**, **strong safety**, and **ridiculous performance**.

🐍 **Python for the Flow**
Business logic, integrations, and app orchestration are written in Python — expressive, friendly, and deeply flexible.

🔒 **Secure & Production-Ready**
Modern security baked in. Ship confidently from prototype to production.

🌈 **Opinionated Yet Inclusive**
Noventa doesn’t aim to fit every use case — and that’s a feature. With minimal setup, you’ll have a stunning, app that just *feels right*.

🎶 **Feels Like a Party**
Coding should feel creative, collaborative, and energizing. Noventa turns your workflow into a jam session — quick iterations, colorful outcomes, and a little bit of disco magic.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Noventa is for the **90%** — the people who want to build, not over-engineer.
We believe:

* Code should be **expressive**, not exhausting.
* Frameworks should **help**, not dictate.
* AI and humans can **co-create**, not compete.
* Every developer deserves to **enjoy** the process.
