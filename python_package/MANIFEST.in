# Ensure starter templates (including dotfile sentinel files like .gitkeep)
# are included in source distributions and built wheels. Settle on
# explicit inclusion because globbing used by package-data does not match
# files starting with a dot (e.g. .gitkeep) by default.

# Include everything under the package's starter directory
recursive-include src/noventa/starter *

# Also explicitly include any .gitkeep files anywhere in the package
global-include *.gitkeep

# Do NOT include VCS metadata like .git/ â€” it's large and not appropriate
# for packaging. If you intentionally want to include .git, add explicit
# include rules here (not recommended).

# Include the .git directory inside the starter template when present.
# Useful when the starter is a copy of a repository template that must
# preserve its VCS metadata. Be cautious: this can include sensitive
# information or increase package size.
graft src/noventa/starter

# Also try to graft any nested .git directory under the cookiecutter project dir
graft src/noventa/starter/{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/.git
